        <div class="timeline-item">
          <div class="timeline-date">Pre-1900s</div>
          <div class="timeline-content">
            <h3>Early Origins</h3>
            <p>
              The roots of comics can be traced to various forms of sequential art throughout human history. Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics, 
              medieval tapestries like the Bayeux Tapestry, and Japanese scrolls all told stories through sequences of images. However, the 
              direct precursors to modern comics emerged in the 18th and 19th centuries.
            </p>
            <p>
              William Hogarth's sequential prints like "A Harlot's Progress" (1731) established narrative sequences of images. Political 
              cartoons and caricatures flourished in publications like Punch magazine in Britain. Swiss artist Rodolphe Töpffer created what 
              many consider the first modern comic strips in the 1830s with his "picture stories," combining cartoon images with text captions.
            </p>
            <p>
              By the late 19th century, illustrated humor magazines like Puck, Judge, and Life featured cartoons and proto-comics, while 
              newspaper publishers began experimenting with comic supplements to boost circulation.

          <div class="timeline-content">
            <h3>Newspaper Comics Era</h3>
            <p>
              The modern American comic strip is often traced to Richard F. Outcault's "The Yellow Kid," which debuted in 1895 in the New York 
              World newspaper. This period saw the establishment of many conventions still used in comics today, including speech bubbles and 
              sequential panels.
            </p>
            <p>
              Newspaper comics quickly became a cultural phenomenon, with strips like Winsor McCay's "Little Nemo in Slumberland" (1905) 
              demonstrating sophisticated artistry and imaginative storytelling. Other influential strips included George Herriman's "Krazy Kat" 
              (1913), which blended surrealism and poetic language, and E.C. Segar's "Thimble Theatre" (1919), which later introduced Popeye.
            </p>
            <p>
              In Europe, different traditions were developing. Belgian artist Hergé began "Tintin" in 1929, pioneering the "clear line" style 
              that would become characteristic of Franco-Belgian comics (bandes dessinées).

            <h3>The Birth of Comic Books & The Golden Age</h3>
            <p>
              The modern comic book format emerged in the 1930s, initially reprinting newspaper comics. Everything changed in 1938 when Action 
              Comics #1 introduced Superman, created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster. This launched the superhero genre and the "Golden Age" of 
              American comics.
            </p>
            <p>
              The success of Superman led to a boom in superhero characters, including Batman (1939), Wonder Woman (1941), and Captain America 
              (1941). Comic books became a mass medium, with millions sold monthly. During World War II, comics often featured patriotic themes 
              and war stories, with superheroes fighting Axis powers.
            </p>
            <p>
              This period also saw the development of other genres, including crime, horror, romance, and western comics. Companies that would 
              later become DC Comics and Marvel Comics were established during this era, along with many other publishers.
            </p>

        <div class="timeline-item">
          <div class="timeline-date">1950s</div>
          <div class="timeline-content">
            <h3>Moral Panic & The Comics Code</h3>
            <p>
              The 1950s brought significant challenges to the comics industry. Psychiatrist Fredric Wertham's book "Seduction of the Innocent" 
              (1954) claimed comics corrupted youth, leading to Senate hearings on juvenile delinquency. In response, publishers created the 
              Comics Code Authority, a self-censorship body that severely restricted content.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Comics Code banned depictions of horror, excessive violence, and any content that might "lower the moral standards of those 
              who read it." This led to the collapse of many publishers and genres, particularly horror and crime comics. EC Comics, known for 
              titles like "Tales from the Crypt," shifted focus to MAD Magazine, which became influential in American satire.
            </p>
            <p>
              During this period, superhero comics declined in popularity, while teen humor comics like Archie and children's comics featuring 
              Disney and Warner Bros. characters thrived under the Code's restrictions.
            </p>

        <div class="timeline-item">
          <div class="timeline-date">1960s-1970s</div>
          <div class="timeline-content">
            <h3>The Silver Age & Underground Comix</h3>
            <p>
              The superhero genre was revitalized in what became known as the "Silver Age," beginning with DC's new Flash in 1956 and the 
              Justice League of America in 1960. Marvel Comics, under Stan Lee and artists like Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko, revolutionized 
              the genre with more complex characters in titles like Fantastic Four (1961), Spider-Man (1962), and X-Men (1963).
            </p>
            <p>
              Meanwhile, a counterculture "underground comix" movement emerged outside the Comics Code, led by artists like Robert Crumb 
              (Zap Comix, 1968). These adult-oriented comics explored taboo subjects, sexuality, drug use, and social criticism. The underground 
              movement established alternative distribution networks and championed creator ownership of work.
            </p>
            <p>
              Internationally, manga (Japanese comics) began developing its modern form, with Osamu Tezuka's cinematic storytelling techniques 
              and diverse genres setting the foundation for a massive industry. In Europe, adult-oriented comics magazines like Metal Hurlant 
              (1974) showcased innovative science fiction and fantasy work.

          <div class="timeline-content">
            <h3>The Rise of Graphic Novels & Mature Readers</h3>
            <p>
              The 1980s represented a watershed moment for comics as a mature artistic medium. Will Eisner's "A Contract with God" (1978) 
              had pioneered the term "graphic novel," and the format gained mainstream recognition with works like Art Spiegelman's "Maus" 
              (serialized from 1980), which would later win a Pulitzer Prize.
            </p>
            <p>
              Landmark superhero deconstructions like Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' "Watchmen" (1986-87) and Frank Miller's "The Dark Knight 
              Returns" (1986) brought sophisticated literary techniques and adult themes to the genre. The direct market system of specialty 
              comic shops allowed for more diverse and mature content to find audiences.
            </p>
            <p>
              Independent publishers flourished, with companies like First Comics, Eclipse, and Dark Horse offering creator-owned alternatives 
              to the major publishers. In 1992, several top Marvel artists would form Image Comics, establishing a major creator-owned publisher.

        <div class="timeline-item">
          <div class="timeline-date">1990s</div>
          <div class="timeline-content">
            <h3>Boom, Bust, and Diversification</h3>
            <p>
              The early 1990s saw a massive speculator boom in comics collecting, with gimmick covers, crossover events, and new #1 issues 
              driving sales to unprecedented heights. This bubble burst dramatically mid-decade, leading to Marvel's bankruptcy in 1996 and 
              industry-wide contraction.
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite these challenges, the 1990s brought greater diversity in comics content. Vertigo, DC's mature readers imprint launched 
              in 1993, published groundbreaking series like Neil Gaiman's "Sandman" and Grant Morrison's "The Invisibles." Autobiographical 
              and literary comics gained recognition through works like Daniel Clowes' "Ghost World" and Chris Ware's "Jimmy Corrigan."
            </p>
            <p>
              Manga began making significant inroads in Western markets, introducing new audiences to Japanese storytelling styles and genres. 
              The decade ended with a shift toward trade paperback collections, changing how comics were sold and read.

            <h3>Digital Revolution & Mainstream Recognition</h3>
            <p>
              The 21st century has transformed comics through digital technology, globalization, and mainstream cultural acceptance. Webcomics 
              emerged as a significant format, allowing creators to publish directly to audiences without traditional gatekeepers. Digital 
              distribution platforms like Comixology (founded 2007) changed how comics are sold and read.
            </p>
            <p>
              Graphic novels gained unprecedented acceptance in bookstores, libraries, and educational settings. Comics scholarship flourished 
              in academia, while literary authors increasingly worked in the medium. The massive success of comic-based films, particularly the 
              Marvel Cinematic Universe (beginning with Iron Man in 2008), brought comics characters to global audiences.
            </p>
            <p>
              The comics audience has diversified, with growing readership among women and younger readers. Genres beyond superheroes have 
              flourished, including memoir, journalism, history, and educational comics. Crowdfunding platforms have enabled creators to fund 
              projects directly through fan support, while social media has created new connections between creators and readers.

            Often called the "King of Comics," Kirby co-created numerous iconic characters for both Marvel and DC, including Captain America, 
            the Fantastic Four, the X-Men, and the New Gods. His dynamic, energetic art style revolutionized visual storytelling in comics, 
            introducing innovations like the "Kirby Krackle" effect. His work on cosmic and mythological themes expanded the scope of superhero

            Spider-Man, the X-Men, and the Avengers. Working with artists like Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko, he developed the "Marvel Method" 
            of comics creation and introduced more complex, flawed heroes. His showmanship and promotion helped bring comics to wider audiences, 
            and his cameos in Marvel films made him the public face of comics for many.

      <h2>Influences & Cultural Impact</h2>

      <h3>What Influenced Comics</h3>
      <div class="influence-section">
        <div class="influence-item">
          <h4>Visual Arts & Illustration</h4>
          <p>
            Comics evolved from various traditions of visual storytelling, including political cartoons, illustrated books, and satirical prints. 
            Artistic movements like Art Nouveau, Expressionism, and Pop Art have all influenced comics aesthetics at different periods. The 
            development of printing technology directly shaped what was possible in comics production.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="influence-item">
          <h4>Literature & Pulp Fiction</h4>
          <p>
            Early comics drew heavily from pulp fiction traditions, adventure serials, and genre literature. Science fiction, fantasy, detective 
            stories, and adventure tales all found expression in comics form. Literary techniques and narrative structures have been adapted to 
            the visual-verbal medium of comics.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="influence-item">
          <h4>Film & Animation</h4>
          <p>
            Cinema has profoundly influenced comics storytelling, with techniques like montage, varying "camera angles," and cinematic pacing 
            adapted to the page. Animation and comics have had a reciprocal relationship, particularly in Japan where manga and anime developed 
            in tandem. Storyboarding techniques from film have informed comics panel composition.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="influence-item">
          <h4>Social & Political Movements</h4>
          <p>
            Comics have reflected and been shaped by the social contexts of their creation. World War II influenced superhero narratives, while 
            the counterculture movement gave rise to underground comix. Civil rights movements, feminism, LGBTQ+ advocacy, and other social 
            justice causes have all found expression in comics and influenced their evolution.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h3>Comics' Cultural Impact</h3>
      <div class="influence-section">
        <div class="influence-item">
          <h4>Visual Literacy & Education</h4>
          <p>
            Comics have played a significant role in developing visual literacy skills. Educational comics have been used to teach everything 
            from science to history. The medium's combination of text and images makes complex information accessible, while requiring readers 
            to develop sophisticated interpretive skills.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="influence-item">
          <h4>Popular Entertainment & Transmedia</h4>
          <p>
            Comics characters and stories have expanded into film, television, video games, and merchandise, creating vast entertainment 
            franchises. The Marvel Cinematic Universe, the highest-grossing film franchise in history, demonstrates comics' influence on 
            global popular culture. Comics storytelling techniques have influenced other media, from film storyboarding to video game cutscenes.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="influence-item">
          <h4>Artistic Expression & Literary Recognition</h4>
          <p>
            Comics have evolved into a sophisticated artistic medium capable of addressing complex themes and employing innovative formal 
            techniques. Graphic novels are now reviewed in major literary publications, taught in universities, and included in library 
            collections. Comics have provided a platform for diverse voices and perspectives that might not find expression in other media.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="influence-item">
          <h4>Global Cultural Exchange</h4>
          <p>
            Different comics traditions—American superhero comics, Japanese manga, Franco-Belgian bandes dessinées, Italian fumetti, and 
            others—have influenced each other through increasing global exchange. Manga's worldwide popularity has introduced Japanese 
            storytelling approaches and visual styles to international audiences. Comics have served as a medium for cross-cultural understanding 
            and exchange.

      <h2>Controversies & Turning Points</h2>

          <h3>The Comics Code Era</h3>
          <p>
            The establishment of the Comics Code Authority in 1954 following anti-comics crusades and Senate hearings represents perhaps the 
            most significant turning point in American comics history. The strict content restrictions decimated many genres and publishers, 
            particularly horror and crime comics. EC Comics, one of the most innovative publishers, was forced to abandon most of its line. 
            The Code's impact on creative expression lasted decades, though it gradually weakened until being abandoned entirely in 2011.

        <div class="controversy-item">
          <h3>Creator Rights Battles</h3>
          <p>
            The fight for creator rights and recognition has been a recurring controversy. Superman creators Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster 
            spent decades seeking compensation and credit for their creation. Jack Kirby's disputes with Marvel over artwork return and 
            credit became emblematic of work-for-hire issues. These battles led to the rise of creator-owned comics and independent publishers, 
            culminating in the formation of Image Comics in 1992 by artists seeking control of their work.

        <div class="controversy-item">
          <h3>Representation & Diversity</h3>
          <p>
            Comics have struggled with issues of representation, with historically limited and often stereotypical portrayals of women, 
            people of color, and LGBTQ+ individuals. Recent decades have seen significant efforts to diversify both comics content and 
            creators, though controversies continue around questions of authentic representation, tokenism, and backlash from some traditional 
            fans resistant to change.

        <div class="controversy-item">
          <h3>The Direct Market System</h3>
          <p>
            The development of the direct market system of specialty comic shops in the 1970s and 1980s transformed comics distribution, 
            allowing for more adult-oriented and niche content but also creating a more insular fan culture. The system's vulnerabilities 
            were exposed during the 1990s market crash. Today, the industry continues to grapple with the limitations of this distribution 
            model as digital comics and bookstore sales grow in importance.

        <div class="controversy-item">
          <h3>Digital Disruption & Piracy</h3>
          <p>
            The digital revolution has created both opportunities and challenges for comics. Digital distribution has made comics more 
            accessible but raised questions about creator compensation and sustainable business models. Webcomics have democratized 
            publishing but often struggle with monetization. Piracy through unauthorized scans and translations (particularly of manga) 
            remains a significant industry concern, though some publishers have adapted with simultaneous digital release strategies.
