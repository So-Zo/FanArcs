        <h2>The Basics</h2>
        <p>
          "Anime" refers to animation originating from Japan. In Japan itself, the term "anime" (アニメ) is used for all animation regardless of origin, but internationally it has come to specifically mean Japanese-style animation. This distinctive art form is characterized by colorful graphics, vibrant characters, and fantastical themes.
        </p>

        <p>
          While anime is primarily produced in Japan, it has inspired animation studios worldwide. South Korea, China, and other countries have developed their own anime-influenced animation industries. Korean animation is often referred to as "aeni," while Chinese animation may be called "donghua."
        </p>

        <p>
          Anime is closely related to manga (Japanese comics), with many anime series being adaptations of popular manga. However, there are also original anime productions created specifically for television or film. For more on the relationship between anime and manga, see our <a href="manga-page.html" class="wiki-link">Manga page</a>.
