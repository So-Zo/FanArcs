      <h3>The Overview</h3>
      <p>Koro-Sensei is the enigmatic and eccentric teacher of Classroom 3-E in the series Assassination Classroom, a popular manga and anime. With his bright yellow, octopus-like appearance, he immediately stands out, but his personality is even more surprising—he's cheerful, compassionate, and incredibly skilled as a teacher. However, there's a twist: he has threatened to destroy the Earth unless his students can assassinate him by the end of the school year.
      Despite his ultimatum, Koro-Sensei's true nature and motivations are shrouded in mystery, making him both a mentor and a target for his students. This page serves as a character overview and fan exploration of his abilities, personality, and role in the story. For a deeper dive into his fascinating backstory, you'll have to watch the show or read the manga—it's worth it!</p>

      <h4>Backstory</h4>
      <p>Real Name: Ryushi Korogane.
      His Upbringing is that of a rough, mysterious and even cruel. He was born unaware of who he was entirely and, nobody knows the name of where he grew, up. Why? well i'll leave that for you to decide.</p>
      <p>Didn't know anything about himself as a child. He didn't know his name, birthday, or even his family. As far as I'm aware, we don't know why, and all we can do is speculate. However, we do know what this environment caused within his ideologies... Blood. Money. Talent. The things that had once made him feel lost and confused, had now shown him the light to get out.</p>
