      <h2>Timeline Breakdown</h2>

        <div class="timeline-item">
          <div class="timeline-date">1910s-1930s</div>
          <div class="timeline-content">
            <h3>Early Origins</h3>
            <p>
              The earliest Japanese animations emerged in the 1910s, with works like Junichi Kouchi's "Namakura Gatana" (1917)
              and Seitaro Kitayama's "Urashima Taro" (1918). These pioneering animators were influenced by Western animation
              techniques but began developing distinctly Japanese approaches to the medium.
            </p>
            <p>
              During this period, animation was primarily seen as a novelty, with short films shown in theaters alongside live-action
              features. The technology was rudimentary, with animators working frame-by-frame using cutout or cel animation techniques.
            </p>
            <p>
              Key figures like Noburo Ofuji experimented with innovative techniques, including his distinctive chiyogami (colored paper)
              animations that showcased traditional Japanese aesthetics.

          <div class="timeline-content">
            <h3>Formative Years</h3>
            <p>
              During World War II, animation was largely co-opted for propaganda purposes, with works supporting Japan's war efforts.
              The first feature-length Japanese animated film, "Momotaro: Sacred Sailors" (1945), was a naval propaganda piece.
            </p>
            <p>
              After the war, Japan's animation industry slowly rebuilt itself. The establishment of Toei Animation in 1948 (originally
              as Japan Animated Films) marked a significant development, as it would become one of the country's most important animation studios.
            </p>
            <p>
              The release of "Hakujaden" (The White Snake Enchantress) in 1958, Japan's first color feature-length animation,
              demonstrated the growing technical capabilities of Japanese animators and their interest in adapting Asian folklore.

            <h3>The Tezuka Revolution & Golden Age</h3>
            <p>
              The 1960s saw the revolutionary influence of Osamu Tezuka, the "God of Manga," who brought his distinctive visual style
              and storytelling approach to animation. His studio, Mushi Production, created "Astro Boy" (1963), Japan's first regularly
              broadcast TV animation series, establishing many conventions that would define anime.
            </p>
            <p>
              This period saw the emergence of distinctive genres and visual styles that would become hallmarks of anime. Robot/mecha
              series like "Tetsujin 28-go" (1963) and "Mazinger Z" (1972) established the popularity of giant robot narratives, while
              "Speed Racer" (1967) brought anime to international audiences.
            </p>
            <p>
              The 1970s brought landmark works like "Space Battleship Yamato" (1974) and "Mobile Suit Gundam" (1979), which introduced
              more complex narratives and themes to what had previously been considered children's entertainment. These series addressed
              war, politics, and human psychology in ways that expanded anime's potential as a storytelling medium.

          <div class="timeline-content">
            <h3>Boom Era & Global Expansion</h3>
            <p>
              The 1980s represented a golden age for anime, with unprecedented creative diversity and technical innovation. The founding
              of Studio Ghibli in 1985 by Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata marked a watershed moment, as their films would elevate anime's
              artistic reputation worldwide.
            </p>
            <p>
              This decade saw the rise of the OVA (Original Video Animation) format, which allowed creators to produce content directly for
              home video without television or theatrical constraints. This freedom enabled more experimental and adult-oriented works like
              "Megazone 23" (1985) and "Bubblegum Crisis" (1987).
            </p>
            <p>
              The international breakthrough of films like "Akira" (1988) introduced Western audiences to anime's potential for sophisticated,
              visually stunning storytelling aimed at adult audiences. Meanwhile, series like "Dragon Ball" (1986) began building global fandoms
              that would explode in the following decade.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="timeline-item">
          <div class="timeline-date">1990s</div>
          <div class="timeline-content">
            <h3>Mainstream Recognition & Creative Diversification</h3>
            <p>
              The 1990s saw anime achieve unprecedented global recognition. Series like "Sailor Moon" (1992), "Dragon Ball Z" (1989-1996),
              and "Pokémon" (1997) became international phenomena, introducing anime to mainstream audiences worldwide and creating massive
              merchandising empires.
            </p>
            <p>
              This decade also brought groundbreaking works that pushed the medium's boundaries. "Neon Genesis Evangelion" (1995) revolutionized
              the mecha genre with its psychological depth and experimental narrative techniques, while "Ghost in the Shell" (1995) explored
              philosophical questions about technology and humanity that would influence science fiction globally.
            </p>
            <p>
              The rise of the internet facilitated the growth of international fan communities, with fan subtitling ("fansubs") making anime
              more accessible to non-Japanese audiences before official localization.

            <h3>Digital Revolution & Global Integration</h3>
            <p>
              The transition to digital animation techniques transformed production processes, while the rise of internet streaming platforms
              revolutionized distribution. Services like Crunchyroll (founded 2006) made anime more accessible globally than ever before, with
              simulcasts reducing the gap between Japanese and international releases.
            </p>
            <p>
              This era saw increasing diversity in content and target audiences. The "moe" aesthetic gained prominence with shows focusing on
              cute characters and slice-of-life narratives, while isekai (other world) stories became a dominant genre. Meanwhile, works like
              "Attack on Titan" (2013) achieved unprecedented global popularity by blending action, horror, and complex political themes.
            </p>
            <p>
              The international influence of anime became more pronounced, with Western animation increasingly adopting anime-inspired visual
              styles and storytelling approaches. Simultaneously, international co-productions and collaborations became more common, blurring
              the boundaries between anime and other animation traditions.

            <h3>Streaming Era & New Frontiers</h3>
            <p>
              The streaming wars have transformed anime's global distribution, with platforms like Netflix, Amazon, and Disney+ investing heavily
              in exclusive anime content and original productions. This has brought unprecedented budgets to some productions while raising questions
              about the sustainability of traditional animation studios.
            </p>
            <p>
              Technological innovations continue to transform production, with AI and other digital tools supplementing traditional animation techniques.
              Meanwhile, the global success of films like "Demon Slayer: Mugen Train" (2020), which became Japan's highest-grossing film ever, demonstrates
              anime's mainstream cultural power.
            </p>
            <p>
              The boundaries between anime and other media continue to blur, with transmedia franchises spanning games, manga, anime, and merchandise.
              The global influence of anime aesthetics and storytelling conventions has never been more pronounced, appearing in everything from Hollywood
              films to fashion and music.

          <h4>Traditional Japanese Art</h4>
          <p>
            Ukiyo-e woodblock prints, with their flat perspectives, bold outlines, and stylized representations, influenced anime's visual language.
            The emphasis on line over shading and expressive faces over realistic proportions can be traced to these traditional art forms.

        <div class="influence-item">
          <h4>Western Animation</h4>
          <p>
            Early Japanese animators were heavily influenced by Disney and other Western animation studios. Osamu Tezuka openly acknowledged

            The trauma of World War II and atomic bombings appears repeatedly in anime themes, from the apocalyptic imagery in "Akira" to the
            anti-war messages of many Ghibli films. Japan's rapid industrialization and economic transformation also provided thematic material
            for many works exploring tensions between tradition and modernity.
