          <div class="timeline-content">
            <h3>Early Origins</h3>
            <p>
              The roots of manga can be traced to various traditional Japanese art forms. The 12th-century "Chōjū-giga" (Animal Scrolls) 
              by Bishop Toba featured anthropomorphic animals in sequential illustrations that satirized Buddhist priests. Ukiyo-e woodblock 
              prints of the Edo period (1603-1867) established many visual conventions later adopted by manga, including bold outlines, 
              flat perspectives, and expressive faces.
            </p>
            <p>
              Hokusai, the renowned ukiyo-e artist, first used the term "manga" (meaning "whimsical pictures") for his sketchbooks published 
              between 1814 and 1878. These weren't sequential narratives but collections of sketches showing everyday life, supernatural 
              creatures, and landscapes. Political cartoons and satirical illustrations flourished in the late Edo and Meiji periods, 
              influenced by Western publications brought to Japan after the country's opening to foreign trade.

            <h3>Early Modern Manga</h3>
            <p>
              The modern era of manga began with newspaper comics and children's magazines. "Jiji Manga" by Rakuten Kitazawa, published 
              in 1902, is often considered the first modern manga series. Children's magazines like "Shōnen Club" (1914) and "Shōjo Club" 
              (1923) featured manga stories aimed at specific gender demographics, establishing a publishing model that continues today.
            </p>
            <p>
              Western comics and animation, particularly Disney, influenced Japanese artists during this period. The four-panel comic 
              strip format (yonkoma) became popular for humor manga. As Japan's militarism increased in the 1930s, manga was increasingly 
              used for propaganda purposes, promoting nationalism and military values to young readers.

          <div class="timeline-content">
            <h3>Post-War Revolution: The Tezuka Era</h3>
            <p>
              World War II devastated Japan's publishing industry, but manga quickly reemerged during the American occupation as affordable 
              entertainment. The most significant development was the debut of Osamu Tezuka, often called the "God of Manga." Tezuka's 
              "New Treasure Island" (1947) revolutionized manga with cinematic techniques inspired by Disney and French films, using 
              dynamic panel layouts and "camera movements" to create a more immersive reading experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              Tezuka's prolific output included "Astro Boy" (1952), "Princess Knight" (1953), and "Kimba the White Lion" (1950), establishing 
              many conventions of modern manga. His work demonstrated manga's potential to tell sophisticated, long-form stories across 
              genres. The distinctive large eyes that became characteristic of manga were partly inspired by Disney animation and partly 
              developed to enhance emotional expressiveness.
            </p>
            <p>
              This period also saw the emergence of rental manga (kashihon manga), inexpensive books rented from shops that allowed 
              creators to explore more mature themes. Artists like Yoshihiro Tatsumi developed "gekiga" (dramatic pictures), a more 
              realistic, adult-oriented style of manga addressing social issues and psychological themes.

          <div class="timeline-content">
            <h3>Diversification and Maturation</h3>
            <p>
              The 1960s and 1970s saw manga diversify into distinct demographic categories with specialized magazines. Weekly shōnen 
              (boys') magazines like "Weekly Shōnen Magazine" (1959) and "Weekly Shōnen Jump" (1968) featured action, sports, and 
              adventure series. Shōjo (girls') manga evolved dramatically as female creators like Moto Hagio and Keiko Takemiya formed 
              the "Year 24 Group" (named for their birth year, Showa 24 or 1949), bringing psychological depth, gender exploration, 
              and innovative visual techniques to girls' comics.
            </p>
            <p>
              Manga for adult readers expanded with seinen (men's) and josei (women's) magazines. Influential works of this era include 
              "Ashita no Joe" (Tomorrow's Joe), a boxing drama addressing social inequality; "Lone Wolf and Cub," a historical samurai 
              epic; and "The Rose of Versailles," a shōjo classic set during the French Revolution. The alternative manga movement 
              produced experimental works in magazines like "Garo," which emphasized artistic expression and social commentary.
            </p>
            <p>
              This period also saw the rise of genres that would become iconic in manga: giant robot/mecha series, magical girls, 
              sports manga, and horror manga. The relationship between manga and anime strengthened, with successful manga series 
              increasingly adapted into television animation.

          <div class="timeline-content">
            <h3>The Golden Age and International Expansion</h3>
            <p>
              The 1980s and 1990s are often considered manga's golden age, with unprecedented commercial success and creative diversity. 
              Landmark series like Akira Toriyama's "Dragon Ball," Rumiko Takahashi's "Ranma ½," and Naoko Takeuchi's "Sailor Moon" 
              achieved massive popularity. Katsuhiro Otomo's cyberpunk epic "Akira" (1982-1990) demonstrated manga's potential for 
              sophisticated science fiction storytelling and was adapted into an influential animated film that helped introduce manga 
              to Western audiences.
            </p>
            <p>
              The economic bubble of the 1980s fueled manga's expansion, with publishers investing in new magazines and formats. The 
              tankōbon format (collected volumes) became the standard way to collect and preserve manga series, creating a substantial 
              back-catalog market. Manga cafés where customers could read from extensive libraries became popular social spaces.
            </p>
            <p>
              Manga began to gain international recognition during this period. Translations appeared in Europe, particularly France, 
              where Japanese comics were respected as "la nouvelle manga." In North America, companies like Viz Media and Dark Horse 
              Comics began publishing translated manga, though often "flipped" to read left-to-right and with cultural references 
              modified for Western audiences.

            <h3>Digital Revolution and Global Phenomenon</h3>
            <p>
              The 21st century has transformed manga through digital technology, globalization, and changing reader demographics. Digital 
              tools have changed how manga is created, with many artists adopting tablets and specialized software, though traditional 
              methods remain in use. Digital distribution platforms and subscription services like Shueisha's Manga Plus offer simultaneous 
              global release of new chapters, reducing the gap between Japanese and international readers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Manga has achieved unprecedented global popularity, becoming a major cultural export for Japan. Series like "Naruto," "One Piece," 
              and "Attack on Titan" have achieved massive international followings. The influence of manga aesthetics and storytelling 
              approaches can be seen in comics worldwide, from American graphic novels to Korean manhwa and Chinese manhua.
            </p>
            <p>
              New publishing models have emerged, including webtoons (vertically-scrolling digital comics) and self-published doujinshi 
              (fan comics) that can achieve commercial success. The boundaries between professional and amateur creation have blurred, 
              with many successful creators starting in self-publishing or online platforms. Manga has diversified further, with greater 
              representation of LGBTQ+ themes, international settings, and cross-cultural perspectives.

      <h3>What Influenced Manga</h3>
      <div class="influence-section">
        <div class="influence-item">
          <h4>Traditional Japanese Art</h4>
          <p>
            Manga draws from various Japanese artistic traditions, including ukiyo-e woodblock prints, emakimono scrolls, and 
            zenga (Zen Buddhist paintings). These influences can be seen in compositional techniques, line work, and visual 
            symbolism. The stylized representation of emotions and use of visual shorthand derive partly from these traditional 
            art forms.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="influence-item">
          <h4>Western Comics and Animation</h4>
          <p>
            American comics and Disney animation significantly influenced manga's development, particularly in the post-war period. 
            Osamu Tezuka openly acknowledged Disney's influence on his character designs and cinematic storytelling approach. 
            European comics, particularly French and Belgian bandes dessinées, also influenced certain manga creators, especially 
            in science fiction and fantasy genres.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="influence-item">
          <h4>Japanese History and Society</h4>
          <p>
            Manga has been shaped by Japan's historical experiences, including the trauma of World War II, post-war reconstruction, 
            economic boom and bust cycles, and changing social values. The emphasis on hard work, perseverance, and self-improvement 
            in many manga reflects Japanese cultural values. Contemporary social issues, from technological change to demographic 
            challenges, are often explored through manga narratives.

        </div>

        <div class="influence-item">
          <h4>Publishing Industry Structures</h4>
          <p>
            The development of manga has been significantly shaped by Japan's unique publishing industry. The magazine serialization 
            model, demographic targeting (shōnen, shōjo, seinen, josei), editor-creator relationships, and the tankōbon collection 
            format have all influenced how manga stories are structured and told. Competition between publishers has driven innovation 
            in content and marketing approaches.

        </div>

        <div class="influence-item">
          <h4>Transmedia Storytelling</h4>

            Manga has pioneered transmedia storytelling approaches, with properties extending across anime, video games, light novels, 
            merchandise, and live-action adaptations. This "media mix" strategy has become a model for entertainment franchises globally.

          <h3>Content Controversies and Censorship</h3>
          <p>
            Manga has faced various censorship challenges throughout its history. In the 1960s and 1970s, gekiga and alternative manga 
            pushed boundaries with explicit content, leading to public debates. More recently, concerns about sexual content, particularly 
            involving young-appearing characters, have led to regulatory efforts in Japan and import restrictions in some countries. The 
            Tokyo Metropolitan Ordinance Regarding the Healthy Development of Youths (revised in 2010) sparked protests from manga creators 
            and publishers who viewed it as potential censorship.

            The shift from print to digital has transformed manga creation, distribution, and consumption. Traditional publishers have 
            struggled to adapt their business models, while new platforms have emerged. Piracy through scanlation (fan translation and 
            scanning) sites has been both a challenge to the industry and a factor in manga's international spread. The rise of webtoons 
            and other digital-native formats has challenged the traditional page-based manga format.

          <h3>Representation and Diversity</h3>
          <p>
            While manga encompasses diverse genres and themes, it has faced criticism regarding representation of gender, sexuality, race, 
            and ethnicity. Stereotypical portrayals of non-Japanese characters have drawn criticism. At the same time, manga has provided 
            space for exploring LGBTQ+ themes, particularly in shōjo and josei categories, though these representations have sometimes been 
            problematic. Recent years have seen more diverse creator voices and more nuanced representations.

          <h3>Working Conditions</h3>
          <p>
            The manga industry has been criticized for demanding work schedules, with creators often working extremely long hours to meet 
            weekly deadlines. Health issues among manga artists are common, with some creators hospitalized for exhaustion. The assistant 
            system, where lead artists employ junior artists to help with backgrounds and details, has been both a training ground and a 
            source of labor concerns. Digital tools have changed workflows but haven't necessarily reduced workloads.

          <h3>Globalization and Cultural Context</h3>
          <p>
            As manga has gone global, questions have arisen about translation, localization, and cultural context. Early localization often 
            heavily modified content for Western audiences, while modern approaches tend to preserve more Japanese elements. The growth of 
            simulpublication (simultaneous global release) has raised questions about whether creators are now considering international 
            audiences when creating manga. Some critics worry about the "flattening" of manga's Japanese cultural specificity as it becomes 
            a global medium.
