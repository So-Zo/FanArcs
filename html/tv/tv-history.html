      <h2>Timeline Breakdown</h2>

      <div class="timeline-container">
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <div class="timeline-date">1920s-1930s</div>
          <div class="timeline-content">
            <h3>Early Development</h3>
            <p>
              The foundations of television technology were laid in the early 20th century, with mechanical television systems
              developed by pioneers like John Logie Baird in the UK and Charles Francis Jenkins in the US. Baird demonstrated
              the first working television system in 1925, transmitting moving silhouette images.
            </p>
            <p>
              By the 1930s, electronic television systems began to replace mechanical ones, with Vladimir Zworykin's iconoscope
              and Philo Farnsworth's image dissector representing significant technological breakthroughs. The first regular
              television broadcasts began in the late 1930s, with the BBC in the UK launching the world's first regular high-definition
              service in 1936, and NBC beginning regular broadcasts in the US in 1939.
            </p>
            <p>
              These early broadcasts reached very limited audiences, as television sets were expensive luxury items owned by
              few households. Programming was limited, often consisting of news, simple variety shows, and special events.
            </p>

        <div class="timeline-item">
          <div class="timeline-date">1940s-1950s</div>
          <div class="timeline-content">
            <h3>The Golden Age</h3>
            <p>
              World War II temporarily halted the development of television, with resources diverted to the war effort. However,
              the post-war economic boom, particularly in the United States, created ideal conditions for television's rapid growth.
              Television ownership exploded, with the number of American households owning a TV increasing from just 0.5% in 1946
              to nearly 90% by 1960.
            </p>
            <p>
              This period is often called television's "Golden Age," characterized by live drama anthologies like "Playhouse 90,"
              "Studio One," and "Kraft Television Theatre" that brought theatrical-quality productions into homes. Early sitcoms
              like "I Love Lucy" (1951-1957) pioneered production techniques still used today, including the three-camera setup
              and filming before a live audience.
            </p>
            <p>
              The 1950s also saw the rise of television news as a powerful force, with journalists like Edward R. Murrow using
              the medium to challenge political figures, most famously in his reports on Senator Joseph McCarthy. Television
              began to demonstrate its power to shape public opinion and influence social discourse.

            <h3>Social Change & Creative Evolution</h3>
            <p>
              Television came of age as a cultural force during the 1960s and 1970s, a period of significant social upheaval.
              The medium played a crucial role in covering major historical events, from the Kennedy assassination to the Vietnam
              War and the Civil Rights Movement, bringing these events into American living rooms with unprecedented immediacy.
            </p>
            <p>
              The 1970s saw television programming begin to engage more directly with social issues. Producer Norman Lear
              revolutionized the sitcom with shows like "All in the Family" (1971-1979), "Maude" (1972-1978), and "The Jeffersons"
              (1975-1985), which addressed previously taboo topics like racism, abortion, and homosexuality. Meanwhile, the
              miniseries format emerged as a powerful storytelling vehicle, with "Roots" (1977) drawing unprecedented audiences
              and forcing a national conversation about slavery and its legacy.
            </p>
            <p>
              Technological advances included the widespread adoption of color television and the development of satellite
              technology that enabled global broadcasting events like the Olympics. Cable television began its early development
              during this period, though it remained limited in reach.

          <div class="timeline-content">
            <h3>Cable Revolution & Channel Proliferation</h3>
            <p>
              The 1980s marked the beginning of the cable television revolution, fragmenting the once-dominant broadcast network
              audience. Cable channels like MTV (launched 1981), CNN (1980), and HBO (which began satellite distribution in 1975
              but grew significantly in the 1980s) created specialized content for targeted audiences, fundamentally changing the
              television landscape.
            </p>
            <p>
              This era saw the rise of the "quality" television drama, with shows like "Hill Street Blues" (1981-1987) introducing
              more complex narrative structures, ensemble casts, and cinematic production values. The sitcom remained a dominant
              form, with "The Cosby Show" (1984-1992) and "Cheers" (1982-1993) among the most popular programs of the decade.
            </p>
            <p>
              The VCR became a common household item, giving viewers unprecedented control over their viewing habits by allowing
              them to time-shift broadcasts and build personal libraries of content. This technology began to shift power from
              broadcasters to audiences, a trend that would accelerate in subsequent decades.

            <h3>Network Renaissance & Global Expansion</h3>
            <p>
              The 1990s saw a creative renaissance in network television, with shows like "Seinfeld" (1989-1998), "Friends"
              (1994-2004), "The X-Files" (1993-2002), and "ER" (1994-2009) achieving both critical acclaim and massive popularity.
              These shows demonstrated that broadcast networks could still create culturally significant programming despite
              increasing competition from cable.
            </p>
            <p>
              Cable television continued its expansion, with channels like HBO beginning to produce original programming that
              would eventually challenge the creative dominance of networks. "The Sopranos" premiered in 1999, marking the
              beginning of what many would later call a new "Golden Age" of television drama.
            </p>
            <p>
              Internationally, television markets were deregulated in many countries, leading to an explosion of channels and
              content. Global formats began to emerge, with shows like "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?" and "Big Brother"
              adapted for dozens of national markets, creating a more interconnected global television culture.

            <h3>The New Golden Age & Digital Transformation</h3>
            <p>
              The early 21st century is often described as a new "Golden Age" of television, characterized by ambitious,
              cinematic dramas primarily on cable and premium channels. Shows like "The Wire" (2002-2008), "Breaking Bad"
              (2008-2013), and "Game of Thrones" (2011-2019) pushed the boundaries of television storytelling, with complex
              narratives, morally ambiguous characters, and high production values.
            </p>
            <p>
              The digital transformation of television accelerated during this period. DVRs became common, further enabling
              time-shifting, while high-definition broadcasts improved visual quality. The rise of internet streaming services,
              beginning with YouTube (2005) and Netflix (which began streaming in 2007), fundamentally changed how television
              content was distributed and consumed.
            </p>
            <p>
              Reality television emerged as a dominant format, with shows like "Survivor," "American Idol," and "The Bachelor"
              achieving massive popularity. These relatively inexpensive productions helped networks maintain profitability in
              an increasingly competitive environment.

            <h3>Streaming Dominance & Content Explosion</h3>
            <p>
              The streaming revolution has transformed television in the 2010s and beyond. Services like Netflix, Amazon Prime
              Video, Hulu, and later Disney+, HBO Max, and others have become major producers of original content, challenging
              traditional networks and cable channels. The "binge-watching" model, where entire seasons are released at once,
              has changed viewing habits and storytelling approaches.
            </p>
            <p>
              The volume of content has exploded, with more scripted series produced annually than ever before—a phenomenon
              dubbed "Peak TV." This abundance has led to greater diversity in storytelling, with shows featuring previously
              underrepresented groups and perspectives finding platforms and audiences.
            </p>
            <p>
              Traditional distinctions between television and film have blurred, with high-budget limited series attracting
              major film directors and stars. Meanwhile, short-form content on platforms like TikTok and YouTube has created
              new forms of video entertainment that compete with traditional television for audience attention.
            </p>
            <p>
              The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated existing trends toward streaming, while demonstrating television's continued
              importance as a source of shared cultural experiences during a time of physical isolation.

      <h3>What Influenced Television</h3>
      <div class="influence-section">
        <div class="influence-item">
          <h4>Radio</h4>
          <p>
            Television's earliest formats, business models, and creative approaches were heavily influenced by radio. Many early
            television programs were adaptations of popular radio shows, and the network structure of American television was
            directly inherited from radio. Even the advertising model—programs sponsored by single companies—came from radio
            before evolving into the commercial spot model we know today.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="influence-item">
          <h4>Film</h4>
          <p>
            Cinema influenced television's visual language, storytelling techniques, and production methods. Early television
            dramas often resembled filmed theater, but gradually adopted more cinematic approaches to camera work, lighting, and
            editing. The relationship between film and television has been complex and reciprocal, with each medium influencing
            the other throughout their shared history.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="influence-item">
          <h4>Theater</h4>
          <p>
            Live theater was a significant influence on early television drama, which was often broadcast live from studios
            designed like theater stages. The anthology drama series of television's first "Golden Age" featured theatrical
            productions adapted for television, and many early television writers, directors, and actors came from theater
            backgrounds.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="influence-item">
          <h4>Technology</h4>
          <p>
            Technological developments have continuously shaped television's evolution, from the shift from black and white to
            color, the introduction of cable and satellite distribution, the development of home recording devices, the transition
            to high-definition digital broadcasting, and most recently, the rise of internet streaming. Each technological change
            has influenced not only how television is delivered but also the types of content created.

        <div class="influence-item">
          <h4>Shared Cultural Experience</h4>
          <p>
            For much of its history, television provided shared cultural experiences on an unprecedented scale. Major events like
            the Moon landing, the Kennedy assassination, or the final episode of "M*A*S*H" were watched simultaneously by vast
            audiences, creating collective moments that transcended geographic and social boundaries. Even as audiences have
            fragmented in the streaming era, television continues to create cultural touchstones that shape public discourse.

        <div class="influence-item">
          <h4>Social and Political Influence</h4>
          <p>
            Television has played a crucial role in shaping public opinion and social attitudes. Coverage of the Civil Rights
            Movement and the Vietnam War brought these issues into American living rooms, influencing public perception and
            political outcomes. Television has both reflected and influenced changing social attitudes on issues ranging from
            race and gender to sexuality and disability, with shows like "Will & Grace" and "Transparent" helping to normalize
            LGBTQ+ identities for mainstream audiences.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="influence-item">
          <h4>Global Cultural Exchange</h4>
          <p>
            Television has facilitated cultural exchange across national boundaries, with programs from one country influencing
            viewers in others. American television has been particularly influential globally, spreading American cultural values
            and English language worldwide. More recently, international television has gained prominence in the US and other
            Western markets, with shows like the Korean "Squid Game" and Spanish "Money Heist" achieving global popularity on
            streaming platforms.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="influence-item">
          <h4>Language and Popular Culture</h4>
          <p>
            Television has introduced countless phrases, references, and ideas into popular culture and everyday language. From
            catchphrases like "D'oh!" from "The Simpsons" to concepts like "jumping the shark" (derived from a "Happy Days" episode),
            television has shaped how we communicate. Television references serve as cultural shorthand, allowing people to express
            complex ideas through shared understanding of shows and characters.

      <h2>Controversies & Turning Points</h2>

      <div class="controversy-section">
        <div class="controversy-item">
          <h3>The Quiz Show Scandals</h3>
          <p>
            In the late 1950s, popular quiz shows like "Twenty-One" were revealed to be rigged, with contestants given answers
            in advance to create more dramatic television. The resulting scandal led to congressional hearings and damaged public
            trust in television. This controversy represented a turning point in the regulation of television and in the medium's
            perceived relationship with its audience. It also marked the end of the sponsor-controlled programming model, as
            networks took greater control over content to avoid similar scandals.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="controversy-item">
          <h3>The "Vast Wasteland" Speech</h3>
          <p>
            In 1961, FCC Chairman Newton Minow delivered a speech to the National Association of Broadcasters in which he
            described television as a "vast wasteland," criticizing the medium for failing to serve the public interest. This
            speech sparked debate about television's responsibilities and influenced regulatory approaches to broadcasting.
            It also contributed to the development of public television in the United States as an alternative to commercial
            broadcasting.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="controversy-item">
          <h3>The "Family Viewing Hour"</h3>
          <p>
            In response to concerns about violence and sexual content on television, the FCC in 1975 pressured networks to
            establish a "Family Viewing Hour" from 8-9 PM, during which only programming suitable for all ages would be broadcast.
            This policy was later struck down by courts as a violation of the First Amendment, but it represented a significant
            debate about content regulation that continues today. The controversy contributed to the development of content
            ratings systems and parental controls.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="controversy-item">
          <h3>The Rise of Cable and the Decline of the Network Era</h3>
          <p>
            The expansion of cable television in the 1980s and 1990s fundamentally changed the television landscape, fragmenting
            the once-dominant broadcast network audience. This shift had profound implications for content creation, advertising
            models, and viewing habits. Cable channels could target narrower audiences with more specialized content, leading to
            greater diversity in programming but also contributing to increasing cultural polarization as viewers could select
            content that aligned with their existing interests and beliefs.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="controversy-item">
          <h3>Reality Television Ethics</h3>
          <p>
            The rise of reality television in the late 1990s and early 2000s raised significant ethical questions about
            exploitation, manipulation, and representation. Shows have been criticized for creating artificial situations that
            cause psychological distress, presenting heavily edited versions of events that misrepresent participants, and
            reinforcing harmful stereotypes. Despite these controversies, reality programming has become a dominant television
            format due to its relatively low production costs and reliable audience appeal.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="controversy-item">
          <h3>The Streaming Revolution</h3>
          <p>
            The rise of streaming platforms has transformed how television content is produced, distributed, and consumed.
            This shift has raised questions about the sustainability of traditional television business models, the impact of
            binge-watching on storytelling and viewer experience, and the concentration of power in a few dominant platforms.
            The streaming era has also seen unprecedented content production, leading to concerns about oversaturation and the
            economic sustainability of what some call "Peak TV."
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="controversy-item">
          <h3>Representation and Diversity</h3>
          <p>
            Television has faced ongoing criticism for its representation of various groups, including women, people of color,
            LGBTQ+ individuals, and people with disabilities. Recent years have seen increased attention to diversity both on
            screen and behind the camera, with movements like #OscarsSoWhite (which affected television as well as film)
            highlighting systemic inequalities in the industry. Streaming platforms have often been credited with providing
            opportunities for more diverse storytelling, though progress remains uneven.
